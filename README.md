# EmailAgent - AI-powered Email and Calendar Assistant

EmailAgent is an intelligent email and calendar management application built with **Spring Boot, Spring AI, and Google APIs**.  
It integrates with **Gmail and Google Calendar** to automatically read, analyze, and respond to emails while managing events dynamically.

## Prerequisites

### **Install Ollama Locally**
EmailAgent uses **Ollama** as the AI backend. You need to install it and download the necessary models.

#### **Install Ollama**

## Features

**AI-powered Email Processing**: Extracts appointment details from emails using **Ollama LLM**.

2. **Ollama AI analyzes the request** and dynamically decides which tool(s) to use.
3. **GmailTool reads emails** and extracts relevant information.
4. **CalendarTool checks availability** and schedules events if necessary.
5. **A professional response is sent** via Gmail with the AI-generated reply.
